      "The meaning of life is one of the most profound and debated questions in philosophy, religion, science, and personal reflection. Different perspectives offer varying answers:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. **Philosophical Perspectives**  \n",
      "   - **Existentialism** (Sartre, Camus): Life has no inherent meaning; we must create our own purpose through choices and actions.  \n",
      "   - **Absurdism** (Camus): The search for meaning in a meaningless universe is absurd, but we must embrace life regardless.  \n",
      "   - **Stoicism**: Meaning comes from virtue, resilience, and living in harmony with nature/logic.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Religious/Spiritual Views**  \n",
      "   - **Theism** (Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, etc.): Purpose is given by a divine being (e.g., to love God, attain enlightenment, fulfill dharma).  \n",
      "   - **Buddhism**: Life’s meaning lies in ending suffering (dukkha) through detachment and enlightenment.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Scientific Perspectives**  \n",
      "   - **Biology**: Life’s \"purpose\" is survival, reproduction, and passing on genes (evolutionary theory).  \n",
      "   - **Cosmology**: From a cosmic scale, life may be a rare fluke with no predefined meaning.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. **Personal/Subjective Meaning**  \n",
      "   Many find purpose in relationships, creativity, happiness, or contributing to something greater (e.g., art, justice, knowledge).  \n",
      "\n",
      "### **Final Thought**:  \n",
      "There’s no universal answer—it’s a question each person explores through experience. Whether through love, work, curiosity, or transcendence, meaning often emerges from how we live, not just why we exist.  \n",
      "\n",
